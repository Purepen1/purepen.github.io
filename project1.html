							<p>	COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus disease, is a highly infectious disease caused by a newly discovered virus called SARS-CoV-2. It was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since spread globally, resulting in a worldwide pandemic. The disease is primarily spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, with symptoms including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. As of March 2023, there have been over 484 million confirmed cases and over 6.1 million deaths worldwide.
								Cleaning the COVID-19 Dataset:</p>
								
							<p>To analyze and understand the spread of COVID-19, data scientists and researchers have created various datasets that track the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries around the world. However, these datasets often contain missing or inconsistent data that can skew the results of any analysis. Therefore, cleaning the dataset is a crucial step in ensuring that the analysis is accurate.
								
							</p>The COVID-19 dataset used in this analysis was obtained from a reputable source and contained information on the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in various countries around the world. The
								dataset contained missing data, duplicate entries, and inconsistencies in the format of the data. Therefore, the data was cleaned by removing any duplicate entries, filling in missing data with appropriate values, and standardizing the format of the data.
								
							</p>Once the dataset was cleaned, it was analyzed to identify trends in the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries over time and in different regions of the world. The analysis revealed important insights into the spread of COVID-19, which can be used to inform public health policies and interventions.
